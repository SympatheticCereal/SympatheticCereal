      The part about me
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am an avid programmer who has experience in many major programming languages, services, tools and frameworks. Most notably Flutter, Googleâ€™s cross-platform framework for building a beautiful, responsive and efficient ui. Currently I have stopped working on flutter projects to focus my time on web development (This website is a statement of my current progress and will be updated according to what i have learnt). So far I have learnt HTML and am currently learning CSS. I am yet to learn JS and its mountain of frameworks (hence why there are no buttons) or SQL/server side plus website security. By the time I am finished with my course I aim to be a beginner full stack developer and work my way up to an advanced one. So keep watching this website as it adapts to my skill set.
